server admin power in a box like Yoda

# Status
very old scripts, which served us well over past 10+ years of managing multiple individual dedicated instances and recently even a few AWS EC2 instances.

I have simply removed some software packages (require replacements), stripped out any password or sensitive data.
Over time, i hope this project will become more abstract and up2date - even it serves only my purposes :)

# USE AT OWN RISK
- Many scripts are build for specific purposes in specific environments
- a lot is still hard coded
- not everything works everywhere
- nothing is tested on multiple linux distributions
